NEXT:

- [X] Stats for nerds reads controller logs
- [ ] Dump the config the payload was generated with in the `about.md`
- [ ] X64 chain busted for some reason
 - [ ] Addtl protocols

- [X] Adding your own controllers/setup section/docs. 
  - [ ] Add a checker that validates the added items fit the needed file struct. 

- [ ] General code cleanup & an adjustment to more "enterprisey"/maintainable if possible.

 #### Bugs & Considerations:
  - Need to check if 2 icmp controllers at once would break. May not due to filtering of PID, tag, and seq.
